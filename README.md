# Angular News Aggregator

This is a **portfolio** project built with Angularâ€”a news aggregator website that fetches the latest headlines from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) and displays short articles on today's news. The design is inspired by major news sites like CNN and BBC, utilizing [Tailwind CSS] for a modern, responsive look. The application features a header and a slide-out sidenav for seamless navigation across different sections.

> **Note:** The free tier of NewsAPI only works on localhost, so the application is intended to run locally.

## Features

- **News Aggregation:** Retrieves current news from NewsAPI.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Includes a header and a slide-out sidenav for easy browsing.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern Aesthetics:** Design inspired by leading news outlets like CNN and BBC.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular:** The main framework for building the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For creating a modern and responsive UI.
- **NewsAPI:** To fetch up-to-date news content.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
